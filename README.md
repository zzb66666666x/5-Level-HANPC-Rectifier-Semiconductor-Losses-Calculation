# 5-Level-HANPC-Rectifier-Semiconductor-Losses-Calculation
This is the loss calculation of a 5-Level HANPC Rectifier Semiconductor.

I want to divide the work by different parts. 
1. define the coefficients.
2. Write the equations.
3. Define a few functions to get information we need from the raw data (by polynomial function fitting method).
4. Generate the input (in another matlab file).
5. Get the result.
#Don't take the ripples into consideration!
